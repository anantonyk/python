a cherry orchard by the house.
above the cherries beetles hum.
the plowmen plow the fertile ground
and girls sing songs as they pass by.
its evening mother calls them home.

a family sups by the house.
a star shines in the evening chill.
a daughter serves the evening meal.
time to give lessons mother tries,
but canâ€™t. She blames the nightingale.

its getting dark, and by the house,
a mother lays her young to sleep;
beside them she too fell asleep.
all now went still, and just the girls
and nightingale their vigil keep.
